            <h1>Behind The BDS Strategy: Infiltrate the Coop</h1>
            <p class="text">
                Tess Brown-Lavoie and Keyian Vafai, the two Coop members who won
                seats on the board of directors in the last election, were
                endorsed by a new faction in the coop called "Park Slope Food
                Coop Members 4 Palestine." The Members 4 Palestine's social
                media celebrated their victory. <br /><br />
                The Members 4 Palestine's website states that it operates in
                accordance with the doctrine of the Boycott Divestment and
                Sanctions ("BDS") campaign. It is fair to characterize Members 4
                Palestine as a local organizing unit of the BDS campaign
                operating inside the coop.
                <br /><br />
                "BDS" does not necessarily refer to an "organization":  it is an
                ideology and a political strategy. Any individual or group,
                however self-designated, can affiliate with BDS––as the Members
                4 Palestine have done. In fact, the BDS strategy includes
                infiltrating every possible level of government, every political
                or professional organization, every academic institution, and
                every community space, and causing them to adopt the
                movement&#39;s agenda and the goal––a boycott of the State of
                Israel until it collapses. The co-founder of the BDS movement
                and its most prominent spokesperson, Omar Barghouti,
                specifically states that introducing the BDS agenda into an
                organization should be divisive. (Nine days after the October 7,
                2023, jihadi attack on Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs, and people
                of other nationalities, the Guardian newspaper published

                    >an opinion piece by Barghouti</a
                >
                in which he explained away the murder, maiming, sexual assault,
                and hostage-taking with statements such as "The reaction of the
                oppressed, whether or not one considers it legally or ethically
                justifiable, is always just that, a reaction to the initial
                violence of the oppressor.")
                <br /><br />
                BDS is ultimately a set of slogans and rhetoric that vilifies
                "Zionists"––meaning, in effect, the majority of Jews
                worldwide––without even a thought as to how the success of its
                agenda would not end in a bloodbath. The ideology explicitly
                rejects any attempt at fostering co-existence between
                Palestinians and Israelis and any dialogue or interaction with
                anyone who does not accept its three agenda points. It is an
                extremist, binary "us versus them" ideology that reduces one of
                the most complicated conflicts in the world to a simplistic
                narrative of good and evil, and accuses anyone who does not
                profess allegiance as "complicit in genocide." This approach can
                be seen in the recruitment efforts by the Coop's Members 4
                Palestine: approaching coop members who are waiting in line to
                enter, asking them if they support genocide, and signing them up
                to join the faction.
                <br /><br />
                As the Members 4 Palestine lay the foundation for restarting the
                2012 boycott campaign and becomes more emboldened, its influence
                has already created a hostile environment for other coop
                members. There is never a guarantee that a community
                organization will survive when its members are fragmented into
                hostile factions, but in the BDS worldview the triumph of the
                BDS ideology supersedes every other value.

            <h1>In-person Meetings</h1>
            <p>
                In person meetings encourage paying attention to what could be a
                many-sided debate for an upcoming vote that evening. It affords
                the opportunity to hear something, meet someone, see something
                new one wouldn't see if they Zoomed in and saw only what the
                video camera revealed. If someone simply logs in through video,
                votes at the required time, and then logs out, this is
                undermining our cooperative spirit. Online voting is being
                suggested by those who want to manipulate, not encourage,
                democracy. Finally, during COVID when we did have voting online,
                the attendance rarely cracked 100, contradicting the argument
                that people are too busy to attend an in-person meeting.

                    >Coop's Mission Statement</a

                says that we are "a member-owned and operated food store—––an
                alternative to commercial profit-oriented business." The Coop's
                low prices are due to its focus on member labor rather than
                shareholder profits. The Coop is not a non-profit corporation;
                it is a corporation organized under

                <strong>We love the Coop</strong> as much as you do, and we fear
                losing it due to the negative consequences flowing from the
                political advocacy of the Coop's Members 4 Palestine, who want
                to pursue a <strong>BDS-driven boycott</strong> of Israeli
                products. The Coop's continued existence is not guaranteed: the
                <a
                    target="_blank"

                    >failure of the Berkley Coop</a
                >, after years of political infighting over consumer boycotts
                (among other issues), is one cautionary tale. <br /><br />
                The Coop's founder, treasurer, and longtime leader, Joe Holtz,
                knows the Coop's future is dependent on its financial health. He
                knows that the unique membership of the Coop––which is in
                Brooklyn, an area with one of the most concentrated Jewish
                populations in the world––means that the damage to the Coop from
                a consumer boycott of Israel could be immense. It
                could include thousands of lost members––overnight––and a reputational decline so severe that the Coop
                may never recover. This is because, whether you agree with it or
                not, a BDS-driven boycott of Israel at the Coop is seen as
                virulently antisemitic by a majority of the Coop's Jewish
                members and a majority of the Coop's Jewish neighbors in
                Brooklyn (home to the largest number of Orthodox Jews outside of
                Israel). The Coop has already suffered from a steep decline in
                Orthodox Jewish members since the last time an Israel boycott
                was proposed at the Coop in 2012. <br /><br />
                The
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodcoop.com/mission/"
                    ><strong>Coop's Mission Statement</strong></a
                >
                also says, "We oppose discrimination in any form. We strive to
                make the Coop welcoming and accessible to all and to respect the
                opinions, needs, and concerns of every member." A
                <strong>BDS-driven boycott</strong>
                of Israeli products at the Coop is disrespectful of the needs
                and concerns of a large portion of its Jewish members. To
                protect the Coop's business and stay faithful to our mission, we
                oppose any boycott proposed by the Members 4 Palestine.
