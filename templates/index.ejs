                        Coop 4 Unity is a diverse group of Park Slope Food Coop
                        members who believe in maintaining a welcoming,
                        inclusive environment at the Coop – without divisive
                        political or social agendas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are concerned and alarmed about the push for the Coop
                        to adopt a BDS (Boycott Divestment and Sanctions)
                        resolution against Israel at our Coop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Members of Coop 4 Unity do not like the division the BDS
                        movement has caused at our Coop. We want to ensure
                        everyone –regardless of their identity– is able to shop
                        for food and feed their family without having to feel
                        intimidated or isolated.

                    <h4>Independence from BDS</h4>

                        <a
                            target="_blank"

                            >The "Park Slope Food Coop Members 4 Palestine" are
                            committed to BDS.</a
                        >
                        "BDS" stands for "Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions."
                        It is an international ideology and a political
                        strategy, the ultimate goal of which is to end the State
                        of Israel as a modern nation-state. BDS explicitly
                        rejects the idea of co-existence between Palestinians
                        and Israelis. Its adherents shun dialogue with anyone
                        who does not accept their position and accuse those who
                        do not join them as "complicit in genocide." The BDS
                        strategy is to infiltrate any organization or community
                        space and push them to adopt the BDS agenda. We seek to
                        maintain the Coop's independence from such an
                        un-cooperative group.

                    <p>
                        Our Bylaws require voting in person (no online voting)
                        at general meetings to foster member interaction, ensure
                        privacy, and verify each vote. The BDS faction wants to
                        change our Bylaws, not to increase your participation or
                        improve Coop governance, but to use their bloc of voters
                        to impose a boycott of Israel on all of us.

                    <p>
                        The Coop is a neighborhood grocery store, albeit a
                        special one. It is not a non-profit, it is not a
                        political action committee, and it is not a social
                        justice organization. It is a
                        <strong><em>business</em></strong> that has to be
                        carefully managed to remain fiscally healthy. The
                        financial success of the Coop depends on the goodwill of
                        the membership. Imposing a political action that is not
                        directly related to the welfare of the store is not in
                        the Coop's business interest, especially when a
                        large portion of the membership is deeply offended by
                        it. Help us protect the Coop's finances by
                        preserving its original peaceful and inclusive nature
                        without divisive politics. <br /><br />
